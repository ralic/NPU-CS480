/*
 Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem:

 A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5).

 Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each type of product sold.

 Each slip contains the following:
 a) The salesperson number
 b) The product number
 c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day

 Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume that the information from all the slips for last month is available.

 Write an application that will read all this information for last monthâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson and by product. All totals should be stored in the two-dimensional array sales.

 After processing all the information for last month, display the results in tabular format, with each column representing a salesperson and each row representing a particular product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month.

 Cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month. Your output should include these cross-totals to the right of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns.
